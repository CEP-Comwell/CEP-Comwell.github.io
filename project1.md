Hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI) is a software-defined IT framework that virtualizes all elements of conventional hardware-defined systems. It integrates computing, storage, and networking into a single system managed by a hypervisor software layer

Key features of HCI include:

Virtualization: Combines compute, storage, and networking into a unified system.
Software-defined: Uses software to manage and control the infrastructure, reducing reliance on specialized hardware.
Scalability: Easily scalable by adding more nodes to the system.
Simplified management: Centralized management through a single interface:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
